The October IDP is the most advanced project I've done yet; it also happens to be the project I feel the least confident in. This project combined things I was familiar with and unfamiliar with. The use of conditionals in this project is relatively new to me and I needed to watch tutorials on how to implement it. I also struggled with combining the different folders so my code initially failed and I had no clue why. The bugs eventually got resolved and I was able to utilize a skill I have not yet used which is debugging: a skill I learned earlier this year. Although this project is not at the caliber I had hoped, I will revisit it in the future with more knowledge and create something more pragmatic and create a better user interface along with it.
