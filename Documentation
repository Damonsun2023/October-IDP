I tried to create a way to make squares change colors to a pattern every time I hit a key bind; similar to my September IDP where it was a random generated sequence of squares. I started off by using my code from my September IDP and see what worked and what didn't. Then, I created functions of keybinds for the color changes I wanted to do. I experimented with color shades until I found one I liked and then once I figured out the colors, I started to work on the squares. I linked the colors and the squares to create something that worked but could no figure out how to make the squares and the colors connect. I later figured it out by connecting the different folders in my index. The reason it was not working before is because it was not recognized. Now, my IDP is an extension of my September IDP and changes the colors to a unique pattern.
